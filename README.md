## Project 1 - Team 2
* Jordan Covarrubias
* Shane Wilmes
* David Irving
## User Story
* I WANT to see recipes that utilize ingredients that are available to me
* SO THAT I can shop for that recipe, or see if I have other required ingredients.

## User Requirements
 |When       | Then
 | --------- |--------
 | I enter an ingredient(s) and other options | I am presented with available recipes using those ingredients and filters
 | I view those recipes | Images are presented showing examples of that meal
 | I access a recipe | I am presented with a list of other ingredients needed for that recipe
 
## Wishlist
 |When       | Then
 | --------- |--------
 | I view needed ingredients | I am presented with the nearest grocery store locations.
 * I am able to save a list of current household items on local storage for future recipe searches
* I am able to add and subtract items from that storage list
* I can sort recipes by dietary restrictions (gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, etc.)
